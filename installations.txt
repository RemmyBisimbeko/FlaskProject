$ pip install flask-mysqldb
----------------------
the easiest way to install mysql I found is to use brew:
-----
$ brew install mysql
$ brew tap homebrew/services
To have launchd start mysql now and restart at login:
$ brew services start mysql
# To restart MySQL
$ brew services restart mysql 
if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
$ mysql.server start
------
in the project folder you do 
We've installed your MySQL database without a root password. To secure it run:
$ mysql_secure_installation
To connect run:
$  mysql -uroot 
OR
$ mysql -u root -p
enter your password. that enters mysql.
12345etc

Then you can do whatever Brad does in the video. Hope that helped someone.
--------------------------
1. go to apple icon --> system preferences
2. open Mysql
3. n instances you will see "initialize Database"
4. click on that
5. you will be asked to set password for root --> set a strong password there
6. use that password to login in mysql from next time
Hope this helps.

------------------------
app.config['MYSQL_USERNAME']='root' should be app.config['MYSQL_USER']='root' . MacOS, 2019.4
